## What is chromesoul?

Chromesoul is a minimalist NetSoul client for Google Chrome. It aim to connect to the NetSoul server and stay active, but does not provide all the functionalities you can expect from a real client.


## Why?

When you're on the PIE, you're stuck in it unless you are connected to netsoul, and with multiple boot and mobile devices it's a real pain to configure many NetSoul clients. That's why chromesoul is awesome: not only it's a multi-platforme NS client, but with the Chrome extension synchronisation it's automaticaly installed.


## Requirements

Sockets have been introduced in Chromium 24. Therefore, it is required to have a web-browser based on Chromium 24 or newer. At the time of writing, it's available on the [dev early release channel](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). For more informations, please refer to the [Chromium development calendar and release info](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/calendar).


## Features

### Active state
Staying in an active state is the main purpose of this extension. It will be implemented as soon as possible.

### Messages
Because the only purpose of this extension is to provide an access to internet when you're on the PIE, there is no plan to support messages at this time. Thoses stupid guys who have fun spamming everyone by broadcasting messages are the second reasons why you won't see any message using chromesoul.

### Contacts
If you cannot send and receive messages, you don't need a contact list.


## Licence

Chromesoul is released under an [ISC licence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license "ISC licence"). See the LICENCE.txt file for more details.
